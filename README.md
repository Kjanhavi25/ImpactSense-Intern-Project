# 🌍 ImpactSense – Earthquake Impact Prediction  

## 📌 Project Statement  

The **ImpactSense** project aims to build a **machine learning-based predictive model** that estimates the potential impact of earthquakes — including **magnitude, damage level, or risk zone classification**.  

Using **geophysical & environmental data** such as latitude, longitude, depth, seismic wave features, and geological parameters, the system can:  

✔️ Assess possible damage  
✔️ Categorize earthquake severity  
✔️ Aid **disaster planning, emergency response, and public awareness**

## 🎯 Use Cases  

### 🏙️ Urban Risk Assessment  
- **Description:** Predict the level of earthquake impact in populated regions using historical data.  
- **Example:** Identify regions most at risk during a **5.5 magnitude earthquake** based on soil type & location.  

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Planning  
- **Description:** Help city planners create safer construction policies in high-risk areas.  
- **Example:** Predict risk level using **soil density** & **fault-line proximity**.  

### 🚨 Government Disaster Response  
- **Description:** Enable emergency teams to prioritize response & rescue.  
- **Example:** Rank regions for **aid delivery** after an earthquake.
